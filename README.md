# Transit Fleet Management Application

This repository contains the complete code and design documentation for a group project focused on developing a **transit fleet management application**. My primary contribution was in the initial system design and database modeling, which is foundational to a robust application.

This repository includes:

* **Complete Source Code:** A fully-functional Java application for managing a transit fleet.
* **Database Design:** The **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** showcases a comprehensive plan for the application's database schema, including key entities like vehicles, routes, maintenance records, and drivers. This demonstrates a strong understanding of data relationships and logical system design.
* **Design Pattern Presentation:** A presentation outlining the **design patterns** used in the application's architecture (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer,Builder), demonstrating an understanding of scalable and maintainable software development principles.

This project highlights my ability to not only design and document a system but also to contribute to its complete implementation and architect it for long-term maintainability.
